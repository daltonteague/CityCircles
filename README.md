You can select the size, color, profile picture, description, and privacy settings for your circle when you create it, and you can edit these preferences or delete your circle as you wish.

Get information and a general feel of the events by the people chatting in them. Circles can be set to private and will eventually be able to have different channels for specific users to use.
